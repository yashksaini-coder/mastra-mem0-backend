# mem0.ts && workflows/index.ts

Proper Context Structure: Each tool execution now properly wraps the input in a context object, which matches the tool's expected input structure.
Type Safety: Using as const for the type literals ensures proper type inference and validation.
Data Validation: The data structures match the schemas defined in the mem0 tools.
The step now:
Properly checks for tool availability
Stores repository information with proper typing
Stores each email with its context
Stores a summary of the operation
All the information is now properly typed and structured according to the mem0 tool schemas, which should resolve the TypeScript errors and ensure proper memory storage.
The memories can be retrieved using the mem0RememberTool with questions like:
"What repositories have we processed?"
"What emails were sent to [person]?"
"How many emails were generated for [repository]?"
